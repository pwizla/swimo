Swimo, a portmanteau word for *Swiss* and *money*.       
Swimo is like a Swiss friend helping you manage your money.

**NEW in v0.2 :**

This release focuses on various improvements to the budget table:

* **Envelopes are now editable**: click on any amount in the "Envelope" column, edit the amount, and press Enter or click outside of the cell to save it. The table is automatically updated and saved!

* **Totals** are computed and displayed at the bottom of table.

* **Introducing 'Conditional Formatting'**:   
Some lines are automatically highlighted to draw your attention on certain alert levels: 

    - when your expenses reach 90% or more of the envelope budget, the line is highlighted with a light orange tone

**Please Note: About budget categories**   
The number of budget categories and their name is not editable in the UI yet. These data are hardcoded in the `src/lib/settings.jsx` file. Feel free to modify it to your own convenience there, by using the same JSON-based format. Be sure to modify both the `budget`and `categories` JSON objects accordingly.
